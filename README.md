## Project Overview

The project is a social networking platform built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It incorporates two major features: an automated content moderation system and context-based authentication. These features are accompanied by common functionalities found in social media applications, such as profile creation, post creation and sharing, liking and commenting on posts, and following/unfollowing users.

### User Roles

There are three distinct user roles within the system:

1. Admin: The admin role manages the overall system, including moderator management, community management, content moderation, monitoring user activity, and more.
2. Moderators: Moderators manage communities, manually review reported posts, and perform other moderation-related tasks.
3. General Users: General users have the ability to make posts, like comments, and perform other actions within the platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nz-m/SocialEcho.git
```
2. Go to the project directory and install dependencies for both the client and server

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

```bash
cd server
npm install
```
```bash
cd ..
npm install @faker-js/faker
```

3. Create a `.env` file in both the `client` and `server` directories and add the environment variables as shown in the `.env.example` files.
4. Start the server

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

5. Start the client

```bash
cd client
npm start
```


### Configuration

Run the `admin_tool.sh` script from the server directory with permissions for executing the script. This script is used for configuring the admin account, creating the initial communities, and other settings.
```bash
./admin_tool.sh
``` 


For content moderation, you need the `PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY` and either the `INTERFACE_API_KEY` or `TEXTRAZOR_API_KEY`. Visit the following links to obtain the API keys:

- [Perspective API](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started)
- [TextRazor API](https://www.textrazor.com/)


## Usage

### Admin

The admin dashboard can be accessed at the `/admin` route. Use the `admin_tool.sh` script to configure the admin account. The admin account can be used to manage moderators, communities, and perform other admin-related tasks. You can also enable/disable or switch API services using the admin dashboard.

### Moderator

Moderators have specific email domain (`@mod.socialecho.com`). When registering with an email from this domain, the user is automatically assigned the moderator role. Moderators can be assigned to different communities from the admin dashboard.
